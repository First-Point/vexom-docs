These specialized agents possess deep integration with their respective chains' protocols, infrastructure, and unique features, enabling optimized performance and comprehensive functionality within each ecosystem.\n\nUnlike general-purpose agents, native agents are built from the ground up with chain-specific expertise, allowing them to leverage native protocols, understand ecosystem nuances, and provide the most efficient pathways for DeFi operations."
