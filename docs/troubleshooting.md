### üë§ Profile and Account Issues

#### **Issue**: Profile picture won't upload or appears distorted
**Solutions**:
- Ensure image is in supported format (JPG, PNG, GIF)

### ü§ñ Agent Interaction Problems

#### **Issue**: Agent doesn't respond or gives irrelevant answers
**Solutions**:
- Try rephrasing your question more clearly
- Be more specific about what you want to accomplish
- Check if the agent specializes in your area of interest
- Try asking follow-up questions for clarification
- Switch to a different agent that might be better suited

#### **Issue**: Agent suggests something I don't understand
**Solutions**:
- Ask the agent to explain in simpler terms
- Request step-by-step instructions
- Ask for the risks and benefits of suggested actions
- Don't proceed with actions you don't fully understand

#### **Issue**: Agent's information seems outdated or incorrect
**Solutions**:

- Report the issue if information is consistently incorrect
- Try a different agent for comparison

### üí∞ Transaction and DeFi Issues

#### **Issue**: Transaction fails or gets stuck
**Solutions**:
- Check if you have sufficient gas fees for the transaction
- Verify you have enough balance for the swap/transaction amount
- Try increasing gas fees if the network is congested
- Check if the token contract is valid and not paused
- Wait for network congestion to reduce and try again

#### **Issue**: High gas fees when trying to transact
**Solutions**:
- Wait for lower network congestion (often evenings/weekends)
- Use agents that suggest optimal transaction timing
- Consider using different blockchain networks (Avalanche, Base)
- Use Layer 2 solutions when available
- Batch multiple transactions together if possible

#### **Issue**: Can't find a specific token or protocol
**Solutions**:
- Verify you're on the correct blockchain network
- Check if the token/protocol is supported on your chosen chain
- Use the security analysis feature to verify token legitimacy
- Ask an agent for alternatives or similar protocols
- Confirm you're using the correct contract address

## Platform-Specific Troubleshooting

### üèîÔ∏è Avalanche Issues

#### **Common Problems**:
- **Network Switching**: Ensure you're on Avalanche C-Chain
- **RPC Issues**: Try switching to a different Avalanche RPC endpoint
- **Token Recognition**: Some tokens may not appear immediately after swaps
- **Bridge Delays**: Cross-chain transfers to Avalanche can take 10-30 minutes

#### **Avalanche-Specific Solutions**:
- Add Avalanche network manually if it's not in your wallet
- Use official Avalanche RPC endpoints for best performance
- Check Avalanche Explorer (snowtrace.io) for transaction status
- Be patient with bridge transactions - they require confirmations

### ‚ü† Ethereum Issues

#### **Common Problems**:
- **High Gas Fees**: Ethereum can be expensive during peak usage
- **MEV Protection**: Transactions might be front-run by bots
- **Network Congestion**: Slow confirmation times during busy periods
- **Layer 2 Confusion**: Make sure you're on the correct network (L1 vs L2)

#### **Ethereum-Specific Solutions**:
- Use gas trackers to find optimal transaction times
- Consider Layer 2 solutions (Arbitrum, Optimism) for lower costs
- Set appropriate slippage tolerance for DEX trades
- Use flashbots or similar services for MEV protection when available

### üîµ Base Issues

#### **Common Problems**:
- **New Network**: Limited protocol support compared to Ethereum
- **Bridge Timing**: Deposits from Ethereum can take 7 days to withdraw
- **Token Availability**: Fewer tokens available compared to other chains
- **Liquidity**: Some trading pairs may have low liquidity

#### **Base-Specific Solutions**:
- Check if your desired protocols are available on Base
- Plan ahead for withdrawals due to 7-day challenge period
- Use native Base protocols when possible for better integration
- Monitor liquidity before making large trades

### ‚òÄÔ∏è Solana Issues

#### **Common Problems**:
- **Network Outages**: Solana occasionally experiences network instability
- **Transaction Fees**: Failed transactions still consume fees
- **Phantom Wallet**: Most common wallet has specific quirks
- **Speed vs Finality**: Fast transactions but occasional rollbacks

#### **Solana-Specific Solutions**:
- Monitor Solana network status before important transactions
- Keep extra SOL for transaction fees, even for failed attempts
- Use priority fees during network congestion
- Wait for multiple confirmations for large transactions
