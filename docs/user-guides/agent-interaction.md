# Agent Interaction

Master the art of communicating with AI agents to get the best results from your Vexom experience.

## Understanding AI Agent Communication

AI agents on Vexom are designed to understand natural language, but knowing how to communicate effectively will help you get better, faster, and more accurate results.

### How AI Agents Work

#### **Natural Language Processing**:
- Agents understand conversational English
- No need for technical commands or programming syntax
- Context-aware responses based on conversation history
- Ability to handle follow-up questions and clarifications

#### **Conversation Memory**:
- Agents remember your conversation within each session
- Reference previous questions and answers
- Build context for more personalized responses
- Maintain conversation flow and coherence

#### **Specialized Knowledge**:
- Each agent has specific expertise areas
- Access to real-time blockchain data and market information
- Integration with various protocols and services
- Continuous learning and knowledge updates

## Starting Your First Conversation

### üöÄ **Getting Started**

#### **1. Choose the Right Agent**
Before starting, make sure you're talking to an agent that specializes in your area of interest:
- **Vexomavax** for Avalanche DeFi operations
- **Chat agents** for general questions and education
- **Social agents** for social media management

#### **2. Begin with a Clear Introduction**
```
"Hi! I'm new to DeFi and want to learn about yield farming on Avalanche."

"I'd like help swapping tokens on Ethereum with minimal fees."

"Can you explain how NFTs work and help me find good collections?"
```

#### **3. Be Specific About Your Goals**
Instead of: *"Help me with crypto"*
Try: *"I want to swap 1 ETH for USDC on Ethereum with low slippage"*

### üìù **Example Opening Conversations**

#### **For DeFi Operations** (with Vexomavax):
```
"I have 100 AVAX and want to find the best yield opportunities. 
What are my options and what are the risks?"
```

#### **For Learning** (with Chat Agents):
```
"I'm completely new to crypto. Can you explain what a wallet is 
and how to stay safe when using DeFi protocols?"
```

#### **For Social Media** (with Social Agents):
```
"I want to automate my crypto Twitter account. Can you help me 
create engaging content about DeFi trends?"
```

## Effective Communication Strategies

### üí° **Best Practices for Clear Communication**

#### **1. Be Specific and Detailed**

**Good Examples**:
- *"Show me yield farming opportunities on Avalanche with over 15% APY and low risk"*
- *"Help me swap exactly 500 USDC for AVAX with maximum 1% slippage"*
- *"Find NFT collections on Ethereum under 0.1 ETH floor price"*

**Avoid Being Vague**:
- *"Make me money"* ‚ùå
- *"Find good investments"* ‚ùå
- *"Help with trading"* ‚ùå

#### **2. Provide Context and Constraints**

**Include Important Details**:
- Your experience level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)

- Budget or amount you want to work with
- Preferred blockchain networks
- Time horizon for investments

**Example**:
```
"I'm a DeFi beginner with $1000 to invest. I prefer low-risk strategies 
on Avalanche and want to understand each step before proceeding."
```

#### **3. Ask Follow-up Questions**

Don't hesitate to ask for clarification:
```
"Can you explain what impermanent loss means in simple terms?"

"What are the specific risks with this yield farming strategy?"

"How much will this transaction cost in gas fees?"
```

### üéØ **Communication Strategies by Agent Type**

#### **With Native Agents (like Vexomavax)**:
- Be specific about amounts, slippage, and risk tolerance
- Ask for step-by-step transaction guidance
- Request security analysis before proceeding
- Inquire about gas costs and optimal timing

#### **With Chat Agents**:
- Ask open-ended questions for education
- Request explanations of complex concepts
- Seek recommendations based on your profile

## Advanced Interaction Techniques

### üîß **Getting More Precise Results**

#### **1. Use Conditional Requests**

If it's below $35, suggest yield farming options instead."

"Show me NFT buying opportunities, but only if the collection 
has at least 1000 holders and recent sales activity."
```

#### **2. Request Comparisons**
```
"Compare yield farming on TraderJoe vs YieldYak for AVAX-USDC pair"

"What's the difference between lending on Aave vs Compound on Ethereum?"

"Compare the security scores of these three tokens before I invest"
```

#### **3. Ask for Step-by-Step Guidance**
```
"Walk me through the entire process of providing liquidity to 
a AVAX-USDC pool, including all risks and steps"

"Give me a complete checklist for safely buying my first NFT"
```

### üé® **Personalizing Your Experience**

#### **1. Share Your Preferences**
```
"I prefer using decentralized exchanges over centralized ones"

"I'm interested in environmentally friendly blockchain projects"

"I want to focus on blue-chip NFT collections with strong communities"

#### **2. Set Regular Check-ins**
```
"Remind me to check my yield farming positions weekly"

"Alert me when AVAX price moves more than 10% in either direction"

"Keep me updated on new DeFi opportunities that match my risk profile"

```

#### **Confirm Understanding**:
```
"Just to confirm, you're suggesting I provide liquidity to earn 
trading fees plus JOE token rewards, correct?"
